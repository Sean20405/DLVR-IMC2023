Image-based 3D reconstruction typically requires precise camera pose information (location and orientation). Traditionally, dedicated hardware is needed to collect this information, which makes the task challenging. If we can retrieve this information purely based on visual hints in photos, we can expand the data sources available for 3D reconstruction tasks.

In this challenge, we are required to retrieve camera poses information from photos via computer vision techniques. Given some photos of a scene, along with their corresponding camera poses, we aim to estimate the camera poses of unseen photos.
